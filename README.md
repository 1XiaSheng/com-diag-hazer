# Abstract

This software is an original work of its author(s).

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hazer
package. Hazer is a simple C-based parser of the National Marine
Electronics Association (NMEA 0183 4.10) strings produced most Global
Positioning System (GPS) devices.  Unlike the Drover project, Hazer does
its own NMEA parsing.  Hazer includes a gpstool utility to display the
interpreted GPS data. gpstool accepts NMEA sentences from standard input,
from a serial(ish) device, or from a UDP socket.

The latest version of Hazer includes the ability to recognize binary output in
UBX format, a proprietary data format generated by U-Blox devices. UBX is
supported by a parallel stack called Yodel that is included in  the Hazer
distribution. gpstool uses both the Hazer stack and the Yodel stack to process
both NMEA and UBX messages interleaved in the same input stream.

# Dependencies

The Hazer library itself is standlone other than the usual standard
C and POSIX libraries. But the gpstool is also built on top of the
Digital Aggretates Corporation Diminuto library. Diminuto is a general
purpose C-based systems programming library that supports serial
port configuration, socket-based communication, and a passle of other
useful stuff. If you don't build Diminuto where the Makefile expects it, some
minor Makefile hacking might be required.

# Display

When using the -E option with gpstool, so that it uses ASCII escape sequences
to do cursor control for its report on standard output,

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -c -E

the display looks something like this snapshot as it is continually updated.
(In this and most other output, the asterisk * is used to mean the degree
symbol. This should not be confused with its use as a delimeter in NMEA
sentences.)

The first line is the most recently read valid NMEA sentence or UBX packet.

The second line is the most recently written NMEA sentence or UBX packet (if
there is one) minus the ending material that includes the checksum for either
format (this is added automatically when the buffer is written).

    \xb5b\x06>\0\0

The third line is the date and time in UTC, latitude and longitude in hours
minutes and decimal seconds, altitude in feet, cardinal direction, speed in
miles per hour, and the current one pulse per second (PPS) strobe value.

The fourth line is the decimal latitude and longitude, altitude in meters,
compass bearing in decimal degrees, speed in knots, the number of satellites
used for the most recent navigation fix, and some numbers indicating significant
digits of accuracy for various values. The text at the beginning indicates
what message was used to most recently update this information.

The fifth line is a list of satellites that contributed to the current
solution (which is frequently a subset of those being received), a count of how
many satellites are in the list, and the quality of the fix in terms of
position, horizontal, and vertical dilution of precision. Later versions of
Hazer have prototype support for receivers with multiple RF stages that are
able to track multiple satellite constellations (for example, both GPS and
GLONASS) simultaneously, and which may arrive at multiple or ensemble solutions.
In that case, the solution displayed is that with the better (lower) dilution of
precision (DOP), and the name of the system used is shown. This can change
dynamically as satellites move in their orbits.

The remaining lines are, for each satellite being received (which is often a
superset of those that contributed to the current solution): a virtual channel
number (purely an artifact of Hazer), the satellite's identifying number (for
the GPS constellation this is its Pseudo-Random Noise code number), its
elevation, azimuth, and signal/noise ratio, and the constellation of which
it is a member. Note that all satellites being tracked are shown, and so
multiple systems are displayed, although only the best solution is displayed.

systems, to capture the NMEA stream on the UDP port.

You may be tempted (I was) to dispense with gpstool entirely and use
socat to forward NMEA strings to a remote site.  Be aware that when
used in UDP consumer mode, gpstool expects every UDP datagram to be
a fully formed NMEA sentence, because that's how it sends them in UDP
producer mode. socat isn't so polite. Since the occasional UDP packet
will inevitably be lost, if the output of socat is piped into gpstool,
it will see a lot of corruption in the input stream. Using gpstool on
both ends means only entire NMEA sentences are lost, and gpstool can
recover from this.

    > socat OPEN:/dev/ttyUSB0,b115200 UDP6-SENDTO:[::1]:5555

The RMC and GGA sentences contain UTC timestamps (and the RMC contains
a DMY datestamp). Hazer rejects sentences for which time runs backwards.
Although this should be impossible for the sentences in the stream from
a GPS device, it is entirely possible for the UDP stream from a Hazer
producer, since UDP packet ordering is not guaranteed.

You might be tempted to use TCP instead of UDP. That sounds like a good
idea: guaranteed delivery, packets always in order. However, this can
introduce a lot of lantency in the NMEA stream. The result is the NMEA
stream received by the consumer may lag signficantly behind real-time,
and that lag increases the longer the system runs. So over time it
diverges more and more with reality.  It is better to lose an NMEA
sentence than have it delayed. After all, another more up-to-date sentence
is on the way right behind it.

You can sent initialization commands to the GPS device. These can be either
NMEA sentences (without escape sequences) or binary UBX sentence (with
escape sequences). In either case, gpstool will automatically append the
appropriate ending sequences including a computed NMEA or UBX checksum.
(The code to write commands to the device depends on being driven by incoming
data from the device, so if the device is initially silent, this won't work.
All the GPS receivers I've tested are chatty by default, so this hasn't been an
issue for me.) Here is an example of gpstool writing proprietary NMEA and
binary UBX sequences to a GPS device that is based on the U-Blox 7 chipset
like the NaviSys GR-701W.

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -c -E \
          -W "\$PUBX,00" \
          -W "\$PUBX,03" \
          -W "\$PUBX,04" \
          -W "\\xB5\\x62\\x06\\x01\\x08\\x00\\x02\\x13\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00" \

          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x06\\x00\\x00"

You can use gpstool with Bluetooth GPS units like the Garmin GLO.

You can test GPS devices independently of this software using the
excellent Linux open source GPS stack. Here is just a simple example of
stopping the GPS daemon if it has already been started (make sure you
are not going to break something doing this), restarting it in non-deamon
debug mode, and running a client against it. In this example, I use the
Garmin GLO Bluetooth device I have already set up, and the X11 GPS client.

    > sudo service gpsd stop
    > gpsd -N /dev/rfcomm0 &
    > xgps
    ...
    > kill %+
    > sudo service start gpsd

Some GPS devices provide a 1Hz One Pulse Per Second (1PPS) signal that is, if
implemented correctly, closely phase locked to GPS time. Hazer and its
gpstool utility are user-space software running on a non-real-time operating
system, so any periodic action by Hazer is at best approximate in terms of
period. But handling 1PPS even with some jitter is useful for casual testing
of GPS devices.

You can test GPS devices like the NaviSys GR-701W that provide 1PPS by toggling
the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) modem control line. This includes devices that
have a USB serial interface. Note the addition of the -c flag.

You can also test GPS devices like the MakerFocus USB-Port-GPS that provide
1PPS by toggling a General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pin. This example (which I've run
on a Raspberry Pi) uses pin 18. Note the addition of the -I flag. (You may have
to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

gpstool can assert an output GPIO pin in approximate time with the 1PPS signal
derived from either DCD or GPIO. This example (which I've run on a Raspberry Pi
with the GR-701W) uses pin 16. Note the addition of the -p flag. (Again, you
may have to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

    # gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -E -c -p 16

The GPIO functions implemented in Diminuto and used by gpstool may get confused
if gpstool exits ungracefully leaving GPIO pins configured. If necessary, you
can deconfigure GPIO pins using the Diminuto pintool utility

    # pintool -p 18 -n
    # pintool -p 16 -n
