# Abstract

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hazer
package. Hazer is a simple C-based parser of the NMEA (National Marine
Electronics Association) 0183 4.10 strings produced by most Global
Positioning System (GPS) devices.  Unlike the Drover project, Hazer does
its own NMEA parsing.  Hazer includes a gpstool utility to display the
interpreted GPS data. gpstool accepts NMEA sentences from standard input,
from a serial(ish) device, or from a UDP socket.

The latest version of Hazer includes the ability to recognize binary output in
UBX format, a proprietary data format generated by U-Blox devices. UBX is
supported by a parallel stack called Yodel that is included in  the Hazer
distribution. gpstool uses both the Hazer stack and the Yodel stack to process
both NMEA and UBX messages interleaved in the same input stream.

If you're wondering why I don't use the excellent open source GPS daemon
(gpsd) and its GPS monitor (gpsmon), the answer is: I have, in many projects,
typically in conjunction with the open source NTPsec daemon (ntpd). Hazer was
developed as an excuse for me to learn in detail more about how GPS works and
how NMEA and UBX sentences are formatted (because I only learn by doing), and
also to develop an NMEA and UBX parsing library that I can incorporate into
the kinds of embedded systems I am frequently called to work upon. Hazer and
gpstool have also turned out to be really useful tools for testing and
evaluating GPS devices.

This software is an original work of its author(s).

# Sentences

Hazer parses the following received NMEA sentences.

* GGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 68)
* GLL - Geographic Position - Latitude/Longitude (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 87)
* GSA - GNSS DOP and Active Satellites (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 92)
* GSV - GNSS Satellites In View (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 96)
* RMC - Recommended Minimum Specific GNSS Data (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 113)
* TXT - Text Transmission (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 124)
* VTG - Course Over Ground & Ground Speed (NMEA 0183 Version 4.10 p. 127)

Yodel recognizes the following received UBX messages.

* UBX-MON-HW - Monitor Hardware can be used to detect jamming. (UBLOX 8 R15 p. 285)
* UBX-NAV-STATUS - Navigation Status can be used to detect spoofing. (UBLOX 8 R15 p. 316)

# Talkers

Hazer recognizes the following talkers as belonging to the corresponding
constellations and systems.

These talkers have been observed in the wild coming from actual GPS receivers.

* GL - GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS) - Russia
* GN - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) - Generic
* GP - Global Positioning System (GPS, formerly NavStar) - USA

Support for these talkers has been unit tested but has never been exercised
using actual GPS receivers.

* BD - BeiDou (as in The Big Dipper) - China

* GLONASS - 65..96

Support for these satellite identifiers has been unit tested but has never been
exercised using actual GPS receivers.

* IMES - 173..182
* QZSS - 193..197
* BeiDou - 201..235

# Dependencies

The Hazer library itself is standlone other than the usual standard
C and POSIX libraries. But the gpstool is also built on top of the
Digital Aggretates Corporation Diminuto library. Diminuto is a general
purpose C-based systems programming library that supports serial
port configuration, socket-based communication, and a passle of other
useful stuff. If you don't build Diminuto where the Makefile expects it, some
minor Makefile hacking might be required.

# Display

When using the -E option with gpstool, so that it uses ASCII escape sequences
to do cursor control for its report on standard output, as this example does
when using the BU-353W10 receiver,

    > gpstool -D devttyACM0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -E -t 10

the display looks something like this snapshot as it is continually updated.
(In this and most other output, the asterisk \* is used to mean the degree
symbol. This should not be confused with its use as a delimeter in NMEA
sentences.)

INP is the most recent data read from the device, either NMEA sentences or
UBX packets, with binary data converted into standard C escape sequences.

OUT is the most recent data written to the device, as specified on the command
line using the -W option.

MON displays some of the results received in the UBX-MON-HW message if enabled.
Ublox 8 chips with firmware revision 18 and above can provide clues to jamming
based on the received signal strength. (N.B. I don't have a way to test this.)
This requires that the jamming/interference monitor (ITFM) be calibrated using
the UBX-CFG-ITFM message. (Although I find nothing in the documentation that
indicates this, I suspect that the dB values in the UBX-CFG-ITFM message are
two's complement signed.)

STA displays some of the results received in the UBX-NAV-STATUS message if
enabled. Ublox 8 chips with firmware revision 18 and above can provide clues
to spoofing based on comparing navigation solutions from multiple GNSSes if
available. (N.B. I don't have a way to test this.) Also shown are the
milliseconds since first fix and milliseconds uptime provided by the message.

LOC is the current local time provided by the host system and (if available
and enabled) wideband and narrowband jamming indicators and spoofing indicators.
The local time, with a fractional part in milliseconds, includes the time zone
offset from UTC in hours and minutes, the current daylight saving time (DST)
offset in hours, and the military time zone letter. If the time zone offset
is an even number of hours (some aren't: Newfie Time, I'm looking at you),
it will be a letter like "T" ("Tango") for Mountain Standard Time as found
in Denver; otherwise it will be "J" ("Juliet") to indicate any local time zone.

All subsequent lines represent the current state of Hazer data structures
updated by data read from the device. Each line includes at its end the system
(satellite constellation) with which it is associated. GNSS indicates that the
device is computing an "ensemble" solution that uses transmissions from multiple
constellations, for example, from both the U.S. GPS constellation and the
Russian GLONASS constellation.

TIM is the most recent time solution, in UTC (or 'Z' for "Zulu"), and the
current value of the One Pulse Per Second (1PPS) signal if the device provides
it and it was enabled on the command line using -c (using data carrier detect
or DCD) or -I (using general purpose input/output or GPIO).

POS is the most recent position solution, latitude and longitude, in degrees,
hours, minutes, and decimal seconds, and in decimal degrees. The latter format
can be cut and pasted directly into Google Maps and Google Earth.

ALT is the most recent altitude solution, in feet and meters.

COG is the most recent course over ground solution, in cardinal compass
direction, and the bearing in degrees true, and degrees magnetic (if available).

SOG is the most recent speed over ground solution, in miles per hour, knots
(nautical miles per hour), and kilometers per hour.

INT is internal Hazer state including the name of the sentence (GLL in the
example above) that most recently updated the solution, the total number of
satellites that contributed to that solution, an indication as to whether the
day-month-year value has been set (only occurs once the RMC sentence has been
received), an indication as to whether time is incrementing monotonically (it
can appear to run backwards when receiving UDP packets because UDP may reorder
them), and some metrics as to the number of significant digits provided for
various datums provided by the device.

ACT is the list of active satellites, typically provided seperately for each
system or constellation by the device, showing each satellites identifying
number (for GPS, this is its pseudo-random noise or PRN code number, but other
systems using other conventions), and the number of satellites in the list.
Unlike the other report lines, the system or constellation to which the data
applies is derived from (in order, depending on availability) the system id
in the GSA sentence (only available on devices that support later NMEA
versions), or an analysis of the Space Vehicle Identifier based on NMEA
conventions, or the talker specified at the beginning of the sentence. The
reason for this is that some devices (I'm looking at you, GN803G), specify GNSS
as the talker for all GSA sentences when they are computing an ensemble solution
(one based on multiple constellations); this causes ambiguity between this case
and the case of successive GSA sentences in which the active satellite list has
changed. Hazer independently tries to determine the constellation to which the
GSA sentence refers when the talker is GNSS.

DOP is the position, horizontal, and vertical dilution of precision - measures
of the quality of the position fix (smaller is better) - based on the real-time
geometry of the satellites upon which the current solution is based. If
multiple constellations are reported, but the DOPs are all the same, the device
is typically computing an ensemble solution using multiple constellations.

SAT is the list of satellites in view, including an index that is purely an
artifact of Hazer, the Space Vehicle IDentifier (same comment as for ACT),
its ELeVation and AZiMuth in degrees based on its ephemeris, the signal to
noise ratio (really, a carrier to noise density ratio) in deciBels Hertz for
its transmission, and an indication as to whether the vehicle is in the current
active list (ACT above) for its constellation.

While NMEA (and UBX too for that matter) is good about updating the application
with new information, it is not so good about letting the application know
when that data is no longer relevant. For that reason, all of the data read
from the GPS devices has associated with it an expiration time in seconds. This
can be set from the command line, in the range 0 to the default of 255. If the
data is not updated within that duration by new sentences or messages from the
GPS device, it is no longer displayed.

# Notes

N.B. Most of the snapshots below were taken from earlier versions of Hazer and
its gpstool utility. The snapshots were cut and pasted from actual output and
may differ slightly (or greatly) from that of the most current version.

## Sending Commands

gpstool can send initialization commands to the GPS device. These can be either
NMEA sentences (without escape sequences) or binary UBX sentence (with
escape sequences). In either case, gpstool will automatically append the
appropriate ending sequences including a computed NMEA or UBX checksum.
Here is an example of gpstool writing proprietary NMEA and binary UBX sequences
to a NaviSys GR-701W which has a UBlox 7 chipset.

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -c -E \
          -W "\$PUBX,00" \
          -W "\$PUBX,03" \
          -W "\$PUBX,04" \
          -W "\\xB5\\x62\\x06\\x01\\x08\\x00\\x02\\x13\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x0a\\x04\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x31\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x3e\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x06\\x00\\x00"

(The code to write commands to the device depends on being driven by incoming
data from the device, so if the device is initially silent, this won't work.
All the GPS receivers I've tested are chatty by default, so this hasn't been an
issue for me.)

If a written command is of zero length (really: has a NUL or \0 character as its
first character), gpstool exits. This can be used by a script, for example, to
use gpstool to send a command to change the baud rate of the GPS device serial
port and exit, and then start a new gpstool with the new baud rate.

## Forwarding Datagrams

Here is an example of using gpstool to read an NMEA sentence stream from a
serial device at 115200 8n1, display the data using ANSI escape sequences to
control the output terminal, and forwards NMEA sentences to a remote
instance of itself listing on port 5555 on host "lead".

## Using screen

You can use the screen utility, available for MacOS and Linux/GNU, to capture
the NMEA stream on a serial port. (And on Windows systems, I use PuTTY.)

## Using gpsd

You can test GPS devices independently of this software using the
excellent Linux open source GPS stack. Here is just a simple example of
stopping the GPS daemon if it has already been started (make sure you
are not going to break something doing this), restarting it in non-deamon
debug mode, and running a client against it. In this example, I use the
Garmin GLO Bluetooth device I have already set up, and the X11 GPS client.
When I'm done, I restart gpsd in normal daemon mode.

    > sudo service gpsd stop
    > gpsd -N /dev/rfcomm0 &
    > xgps
    ...
    > kill %+
    > sudo service start gpsd

## Using socat

You can use the socat utility, available for Linux/GNU and MacOS flavored
systems, to capture the NMEA stream on the UDP port.

    > socat UDP6-RECVFROM:5555,reuseaddr,fork STDOUT

    $GPGSA,M,3,32,10,14,18,31,11,24,08,21,27,01,,1.3,0.8,1.1*33
    $GPGSV,3,1,12,32,79,305,39,10,66,062,41,14,58,247,35,18,40,095,34*72
    $GPGSV,3,2,12,31,21,180,45,11,20,309,27,24,19,044,30,08,17,271,31*7A
    $GPGSV,3,3,12,21,13,156,39,27,13,233,33,01,09,320,20,51,43,183,42*72

You may be tempted (I was) to dispense with gpstool entirely and use
socat to forward NMEA strings to a remote site.  Be aware that when
used in UDP consumer mode, gpstool expects every UDP datagram to be
a fully formed NMEA sentence, because that's how it sends them in UDP
producer mode. socat isn't so polite. Since the occasional UDP packet
will inevitably be lost, if the output of socat is piped into gpstool,
it will see a lot of corruption in the input stream. Using gpstool on
both ends means only entire NMEA sentences are lost, and gpstool can
recover from this.

    > socat OPEN:/dev/ttyUSB0,b115200 UDP6-SENDTO:[::1]:5555

The RMC and GGA sentences contain UTC timestamps (and the RMC contains
a DMY datestamp). Hazer rejects sentences for which time runs backwards.
Although this should be impossible for the sentences in the stream from
a GPS device, it is entirely possible for the UDP stream from a Hazer
producer, since UDP packet ordering is not guaranteed.

You might be tempted to use TCP instead of UDP. That sounds like a good
idea: guaranteed delivery, packets always in order. However, this can
introduce a lot of lantency in the NMEA stream. The result is the NMEA
stream received by the consumer may lag signficantly behind real-time,
and that lag increases the longer the system runs. So over time it
diverges more and more with reality.  It is better to lose an NMEA
sentence than have it delayed. After all, another more up-to-date sentence
is on the way right behind it.

## Using Bluetooth

## Using One Pulse Per Second

Some GPS devices provide a 1Hz One Pulse Per Second (1PPS) signal that is, if
implemented correctly, closely phase locked to GPS time. Hazer and its
gpstool utility are user-space software running on a non-real-time operating
system, so any periodic action by Hazer is at best approximate in terms of
period. But handling 1PPS even with some jitter is useful for casual testing
of GPS devices.

You can test GPS devices like the NaviSys GR-701W that provide 1PPS by toggling
the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) modem control line. This includes devices that
have a USB serial interface. Note the addition of the -c flag.

You can also test GPS devices like the MakerFocus USB-Port-GPS that provide
1PPS by toggling a General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pin. This example (which I've run
on a Raspberry Pi) uses pin 18. Note the addition of the -I flag. (You may have
to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

gpstool can assert an output GPIO pin in approximate syntonization with the
1PPS signal derived from either DCD or GPIO. This example (which I've run on a
Raspberry Pi with the GR-701W) uses pin 16. Note the addition of the -p flag.
(Again, you may have to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

    # gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -E -c -p 16

The GPIO functions implemented in Diminuto and used by gpstool may get confused
if gpstool exits ungracefully leaving GPIO pins configured. If necessary, you
can deconfigure GPIO pins using the Diminuto pintool utility

    # pintool -p 18 -n
    # pintool -p 16 -n

## True Versus Magnetic Bearings

GPS devices compute the true bearing by comparing successive position fixes to
determine your speed and direction. Hence, the true bearing, e.g. "135.000\*T",
is only reliable if you are moving, and at a speed fast enough to be within
the resolution of the accuracy of the position fix. The magnetic bearing is an
actual magnetic compass bearing, but is only provided by GPS devices which also
have a magnetic compass; otherwise it will be displayed as "0.000\*M". The
cardinal compass direction, e.g. "SE", is based on the true bearing.

## Google Earth Pro

In February 2017 I used Hazer with Google Earth Pro, the desktop version of the
web based application. Today, August 2018, the real-time GPS feature of Google
Earth Pro no longer seems to work with latest version, 7.3.2, for the Mac (I
haven't tried it for other operating systems). Neither does 7.3.1. But 7.1.8
works.

Google Earth Pro only accepts GPS data on a serial port, or at least something
that kinda sorta looks like a serial port. I've used a FIFO (named pipe), via
the mkfifo(1) command, for stuff like this in the past, but there doesn't seem
to be any way to get Pro to recognize the FIFO; only serial(ish) devices may
apply here.

So I processed the NMEA stream from a serial-attached GPS device using gpstool
running on a Raspberry Pi, then forwarded it via UDP datagrams to another
gpstool on the Raspberry Pi. (This is the bin/producer.sh script.)

    gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 4800 -8 -n -1 -6 -c -A ip6-localhost -P 5555 -E

Then I used the second gpstool to forward the NMEA stream out a serial port
across a two FTDI USB-to-serial adaptors hooked back-to-back with a null
modem in between, to a Mac running Google Earth Pro. (This is the
bin/provider.sh script.)

    gpstool -6 -P 5555 -O -D /dev/ttyUSB1 -b 4800 -8 -n -1

I used the "GPS Import Realtime" drop down menu in Google Earth Pro to select
the USB serial device representing the other end of the FTDI "milking
machine". The menu liked the device "/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX" where the Xs
are some kind of internal identifier on MacOS where Pro was running. 

Empirically, and according to a Google search, anecdotally, but undocumentedly,
Google Earth Pro appears to only accept serial input at 4800 baud. More recent
and advanced GPS devices default to 9600 baud, and can overrun a 4800 baud
serial port. So I used a USGlobalSat BU-353S4, which defaults to 4800 baud, as
my GPS device on the Linux server.

As Rube Goldberg as this is, it seems to work.

## NMEA TXT Sentences

Some devices are chatty and emit interesting and sometimes useful information
as NMEA TXT sentences. These can be recognized by Hazer and logged to standard
error by gpstool. Some of the functional tests save standard error output in
log files under the build artifact directory, or redirected to the system log
using the Diminuto log command as shown below.

## Phantom GPS Satellite PRN 4

Around 2018-11-29T12:00-07:00, I was testing some changes to Hazer with
the Ublox-8 based BU353W10 receiver by comparing its results to those
of the web site <https://in-the-sky.org/satmap_radar.php> that presents
a real-time sky map of the visible orbiting space vehicles (not just
GPS). I noticed that my BU353W10 was reporting GPS PRN 4 as "in view"
with a zero elevation and zero azimuth; that vehicle wasn't reported by
the sky map. Worse: a little web-search-fu told me that there was no PRN
4; it does not appear in the most recent GPS almanac. The GPS vehicle
using PRN 4 was decommisioned and its pseudo-random number code has
not yet been reused.

Before I could do much else, PRN 4 dropped from view.

PRN 4 reappeared the next morning around 2018-11-30T09:00-07:00. I
quickly dumped the raw NMEA and verified using NMEA 0183 Version 4.10
pp. 96-97 that I wasn't decoding the GSV sentence incorrectly.

    $GPGSV,4,1,15,04,,,36,05,04,062,22,10,27,253,32,13,32,053,38*43\r\n
    $GPGSV,4,2,15,15,60,092,39,16,15,289,26,20,53,269,,21,72,336,22*75\r\n
    $GPGSV,4,3,15,24,06,129,33,26,10,264,15,27,11,322,31,29,36,170,50*78\r\n
    $GPGSV,4,4,15,46,38,215,45,48,36,220,43,51,44,183,44*43\r\n

However, I noticed that the elevation and azimuth for PRN 4 weren't actually
zero: they were empty strings, although the SNR was a reasonable (and changing
over time) value. I coded up a change to Hazer to detect this and mark it, and
to gpstool to display a '?' next to that SAT entry. I was able to test this
before PRN 4 again dropped from view.

PRN 4 reappeared about twenty minutes later.

It continues to drop from view and reappear. Its period of appearance does
not coincide with the GPS orbital period.

Neither NMEA 0183 4.10 nor Ublox 8 R15 suggests any interpretation of the
empty elevation and azimuth fields. As always, I'm assuming this somehow is
a bug in my code. But it does occur to me that PRN 4 would be useful for
testing a ground-based GPS transmitter; the period of its appearance would
make sense for a transmitter in the continental America time zones.
