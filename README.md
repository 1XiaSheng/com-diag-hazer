# Abstract

This software is an original work of its author(s).

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hazer
package. Hazer is a simple C-based parser of the National Marine
Electronics Association (NMEA 0183 4.10) strings produced most Global
Positioning System (GPS) devices.  Unlike the Drover project, Hazer does
its own NMEA parsing.  Hazer includes a gpstool utility to display the
interpreted GPS data. gpstool accepts NMEA sentences from standard input,
from a serial(ish) device, or from a UDP socket.

The latest version of Hazer includes the ability to recognize binary output in
UBX format, a proprietary data format generated by U-Blox devices. UBX is
supported by a parallel stack called Yodel that is included in  the Hazer
distribution. gpstool uses both the Hazer stack and the Yodel stack to process
both NMEA and UBX messages interleaved in the same input stream.

If you're wondering why I don't use the excellent open source GPS daemon
(gpsd) and its GPS monitor (gpsmon), the answer is: I have, in several projects,
typically in conjunction with the open source NTPsec daemon (ntpd). Hazer was
developed as an excuse for me to learn in detail more about how GPS works and
how NMEA and UBX sentences are formatted (because I only learn by doing), and
also to develop an NMEA and UBX parsing library that I can incorporate into
the kinds of embedded systems I am frequently called to work upon. Hazer and
gpstool have also turned out to be really useful tools for testing and
evaluating GPS devices.

# Dependencies

The Hazer library itself is standlone other than the usual standard
C and POSIX libraries. But the gpstool is also built on top of the
Digital Aggretates Corporation Diminuto library. Diminuto is a general
purpose C-based systems programming library that supports serial
port configuration, socket-based communication, and a passle of other
useful stuff. If you don't build Diminuto where the Makefile expects it, some
minor Makefile hacking might be required.

# Display

When using the -E option with gpstool, so that it uses ASCII escape sequences
to do cursor control for its report on standard output,

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -c -E -t 10

and when using a GPS receiver that can only receive a single frequency range
at a time (so it can only detect GPS, or only GLONASS, but not both
simultaneously), the display looks something like this snapshot as it is
continually updated. (In this and most other output, the asterisk \* is used to
mean the degree symbol. This should not be confused with its use as a delimeter
in NMEA sentences.)

current one pulse per second (PPS) strobe value, an expiration period that is
the number of seconds that must elapse for this particular fix to be considered
stale because no update for the GNSS from which is was computed has been
received, and the constellation being used for the fix (GNSS is multiple
constellations are being used). (The next line has much the same information

Line 5 (and perhaps subsequent) is a list of active satellites that contributed
to the a solution (which is frequently a subset of those being received), a
count of how many satellites are in the list, the quality of the fix in terms
of position, horizontal, and vertical dilution of precision, an expiration
time, and the GNSS to which this applies. Later versions of Hazer have prototype
support for receivers with multiple RF stages that are able to track multiple
satellite constellations (for example, both GPS and GLONASS) simultaneously,
and which may arrive at multiple or ensemble solutions. The GNSS displayed
is the one to which the satellites belong, or "GNSS" if there is more than one
GNSS in the list.

The remaining lines are, for each satellite being viewed (which is often a
superset of those that contributed to the current solution): a virtual channel
number (purely an artifact of Hazer), the satellite's identifying number (for
the GPS constellation this is its Pseudo-Random Noise or PRN code number), its
elevation and azimuth in degrees, and its signal/noise ratio, am expiration
time, and the GNSS of which it is a member. Note that all satellites being 
racked are shown, and so multiple systems may be displayed.

# Notes

N.B. Some of the snapshots below were taken from earlier versions of Hazer and
its gpstool utility. The snapshots were cut and pasted from actual output and
may differ slightly from that of the most current version.

## Sending Commands

gpstool can send initialization commands to the GPS device. These can be either
NMEA sentences (without escape sequences) or binary UBX sentence (with
escape sequences). In either case, gpstool will automatically append the
appropriate ending sequences including a computed NMEA or UBX checksum.
Here is an example of gpstool writing proprietary NMEA and binary UBX sequences
to a NaviSys GR-701W which has a UBlox 7 chipset.

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -c -E \
          -W "\$PUBX,00" \
          -W "\$PUBX,03" \
          -W "\$PUBX,04" \
          -W "\\xB5\\x62\\x06\\x01\\x08\\x00\\x02\\x13\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x0a\\x04\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x31\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x3e\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x06\\x00\\x00"

(The code to write commands to the device depends on being driven by incoming
data from the device, so if the device is initially silent, this won't work.
All the GPS receivers I've tested are chatty by default, so this hasn't been an
issue for me.)

If a written command is of zero length (really: has a NUL or \0 character as its
first character), gpstool exits. This can be used by a script, for example, to
use gpstool to send a command to change the baud rate of the GPS device serial
port and exit, and then start a new gpstool with the new baud rate.

## Forwarding Datagrams

Here is an example of using gpstool to read an NMEA sentence stream from a
serial device at 115200 8n1, display the data using ANSI escape sequences to
control the output terminal, and forwards NMEA sentences to a remote
instance of itself listing on port 5555 on host "lead".

## Using screen

You can use the screen utility, available for MacOS and Linux/GNU, to capture
the NMEA stream on a serial port. (And on Windows systems, I use PuTTY.)

## Using gpsd

You can test GPS devices independently of this software using the
excellent Linux open source GPS stack. Here is just a simple example of
stopping the GPS daemon if it has already been started (make sure you
are not going to break something doing this), restarting it in non-deamon
debug mode, and running a client against it. In this example, I use the
Garmin GLO Bluetooth device I have already set up, and the X11 GPS client.
When I'm done, I restart gpsd in normal daemon mode.

    > sudo service gpsd stop
    > gpsd -N /dev/rfcomm0 &
    > xgps
    ...
    > kill %+
    > sudo service start gpsd

## Using socat

You can use the socat utility, available for Linux/GNU and MacOS flavored
systems, to capture the NMEA stream on the UDP port.

    > socat UDP6-RECVFROM:5555,reuseaddr,fork STDOUT

    $GPGSA,M,3,32,10,14,18,31,11,24,08,21,27,01,,1.3,0.8,1.1*33
    $GPGSV,3,1,12,32,79,305,39,10,66,062,41,14,58,247,35,18,40,095,34*72
    $GPGSV,3,2,12,31,21,180,45,11,20,309,27,24,19,044,30,08,17,271,31*7A
    $GPGSV,3,3,12,21,13,156,39,27,13,233,33,01,09,320,20,51,43,183,42*72

You may be tempted (I was) to dispense with gpstool entirely and use
socat to forward NMEA strings to a remote site.  Be aware that when
used in UDP consumer mode, gpstool expects every UDP datagram to be
a fully formed NMEA sentence, because that's how it sends them in UDP
producer mode. socat isn't so polite. Since the occasional UDP packet
will inevitably be lost, if the output of socat is piped into gpstool,
it will see a lot of corruption in the input stream. Using gpstool on
both ends means only entire NMEA sentences are lost, and gpstool can
recover from this.

    > socat OPEN:/dev/ttyUSB0,b115200 UDP6-SENDTO:[::1]:5555

The RMC and GGA sentences contain UTC timestamps (and the RMC contains
a DMY datestamp). Hazer rejects sentences for which time runs backwards.
Although this should be impossible for the sentences in the stream from
a GPS device, it is entirely possible for the UDP stream from a Hazer
producer, since UDP packet ordering is not guaranteed.

You might be tempted to use TCP instead of UDP. That sounds like a good
idea: guaranteed delivery, packets always in order. However, this can
introduce a lot of lantency in the NMEA stream. The result is the NMEA
stream received by the consumer may lag signficantly behind real-time,
and that lag increases the longer the system runs. So over time it
diverges more and more with reality.  It is better to lose an NMEA
sentence than have it delayed. After all, another more up-to-date sentence
is on the way right behind it.

## Using Bluetooth

You can use gpstool with Bluetooth GPS units like the Garmin GLO.

## Using One Pulse Per Second

Some GPS devices provide a 1Hz One Pulse Per Second (1PPS) signal that is, if
implemented correctly, closely phase locked to GPS time. Hazer and its
gpstool utility are user-space software running on a non-real-time operating
system, so any periodic action by Hazer is at best approximate in terms of
period. But handling 1PPS even with some jitter is useful for casual testing
of GPS devices.

You can test GPS devices like the NaviSys GR-701W that provide 1PPS by toggling
the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) modem control line. This includes devices that
have a USB serial interface. Note the addition of the -c flag.

You can also test GPS devices like the MakerFocus USB-Port-GPS that provide
1PPS by toggling a General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pin. This example (which I've run
on a Raspberry Pi) uses pin 18. Note the addition of the -I flag. (You may have
to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

gpstool can assert an output GPIO pin in approximate syntonization with the
1PPS signal derived from either DCD or GPIO. This example (which I've run on a
Raspberry Pi with the GR-701W) uses pin 16. Note the addition of the -p flag.
(Again, you may have to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

    # gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -E -c -p 16

The GPIO functions implemented in Diminuto and used by gpstool may get confused
if gpstool exits ungracefully leaving GPIO pins configured. If necessary, you
can deconfigure GPIO pins using the Diminuto pintool utility

    # pintool -p 18 -n
    # pintool -p 16 -n

## True Versus Magnetic Bearings

GPS devices compute the true bearing by comparing successive position fixes to
determine your speed and direction. Hence, the true bearing, e.g. "135.000\*T",
is only reliable if you are moving, and at a speed fast enough to be within
the resolution of the accuracy of the position fix. The magnetic bearing is an
actual magnetic compass bearing, but is only provided by GPS devices which also
have a magnetic compass; otherwise it will be displayed as "0.000\*M". The
cardinal compass direction, e.g. "SE", is based on the true bearing.

## Google Earth

In February 2017 I  used Hazer with Google Earth Pro, the desktop version of the
web based application. Today, August 2018, the real-time GPS feature of Google
Earth Pro no longer seems to work with latest version, 7.3.2, for the Mac (I
haven't tried it for other operating systems). Neither does 7.3.1. But 7.1.8
seems to work.

Google Earth only accepts GPS data on a serial port, or at least something that
kinda sorta looks like a serial port. So I process the NMEA stream from a
serial-attached GPS device using gpstool running on a Linux server, then
forwarded it via UDP datagrams to another gpstool on the same server, and then
use that gpstool to forward the NMEA stream out a serial port across a two FTDI
USB-to-serial adaptors hooked back-to-back with a null modem in between, to a
Mac running Google Earth Pro.

Note that empirically and anecdotally, Google Earth Pro appears to only accept
serial input at 4800 baud. More recent and advanced GPS devices default to 9600
baud, and will overrun a 4800 baud serial port. So I used a USGlobalSat
BU-353S4, which defaults to 4800 baud, as my GPS device on the Linux server.

As Rube Goldberg as this is, it seems to work.
