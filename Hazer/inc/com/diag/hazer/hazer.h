 * This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hazer package.
 * Hazer is a simple C-based parser of the National Marine Electronics
 * Association (NMEA) strings produced by the USGlobalSat BU-353S4 Global
 * Positioning System (GPS) device, a tiny little external GPS receiver that
 * emits NMEA strings over its built-in USB-to-serial adaptor. The BU-353S4
 * is based on the SiRF Star IV chipset. If you want to futz around with
 * satellite geolocation, the BU-353S4 is a cheap and easy way to do it.
